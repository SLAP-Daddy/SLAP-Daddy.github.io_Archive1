## Web Design

**[Grateful Head Hair Studio Website](https://www.gratefulheadstudio.com/)**
<br>
<br>
I worked with the hair studio owner to collect and sharpen the vision for her website. Developed site on Wix. Development highlights include lightbox pop ups for COVID-19 guidelines, allowing visitors to download/print PDFs ahead of thier appointment, and a contact me form that submits responses directly to email.

## Daily Horoscope Discord Bot
I created a discord bot that scans for text commands on a discord server and responds to parameterized imputs. Also sends daily horoscopes to a certian channel every day at 10AM CST via a scheduled job. Bot lives on a Wi-Fi enabled arduino. Calls to a rest API for daily horoscope information.

## Desk LED Lights
<br>
I designed a LED lighting setup to give little brother and I's dreary basement gaming setup a little more pizzaz. I soldered together various stips of addressable LEDs and hooked them into an arduino. A few custom configuations meant to pair well with keybord/rig color schemes were coded and rest on the device. You can cycle through them with a button.
