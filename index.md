## Web Design

**[Grateful Head Hair Studio Website](https://www.gratefulheadstudio.com/)**
<br>
<br>
I worked with the hair studio owner to collect and sharpen the vision for her website. Developed site on Wix. Development highlights include lightbox pop ups for COVID-19 guidelines, allowing visitors to download/print PDFs ahead of thier appointment, and a "contact me" form that submits responses directly to email.

## Daily Horoscope Discord Bot
I created a discord bot that scans for text commands on a discord server and responds to parameterized imputs. Also sends daily horoscopes to a certian channel every day at 10AM CST via a scheduled job. Bot lives on a Wi-Fi enabled arduino. Calls to a rest API for daily horoscope information.

## Desk LED Lights
I designed a LED lighting setup to give little brother and I's dreary basement gaming setup a little more pizzaz. I soldered together various stips of addressable LEDs and hooked them into an arduino. A few custom configuations meant to pair well with keybord/rig color schemes were coded and rest on the device. You can cycle through them with a button.

## LED Neon Sign 
I put together the plans and executed the work to create a LED "Neon" Sign for my friend's dad. He started acumulating pinball machines in his garage and I thought it right to gift him something in return for all the wear and tear I was putting on his machines, as well as crushing his high scores. Put together the wood base, routed the design, and slotted then wired the LEDs. Will likely be doing more of these when time allows!

## Insect Photography

My dream as a kid was to be an entomologist! I used to raise and release all kinds of creatures to adulthood. Nowadays I stick to just taking pictures of them to catalog which ones I've seen in real life!
